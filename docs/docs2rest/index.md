# Introduction

`docs2rest` is a tool that's able to convert a Markdown file into a working REST API.

The tool is *template based*, so you can use it to convert any Markdown file into your desired REST API.
At the moment, `docs2rest` ships with two templates:

* `liwe3`	- Convert the Markdown file into a REST API that uses the `liwe3` framework.
* `nextjs`	- Convert the Markdown file into a REST API that uses the `nextjs` / React and liwe3 framework.

Both these templates are almost unuseful for you, if you are not using the `liwe3` framework, but you can use them as a reference to create your own template.
