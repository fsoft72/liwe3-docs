# LiWE 3

## What is LiWE 3

`liwe3` is both a *framework* and an *environment* for developing applications.

It is *lightweight*, *easy to use* , *open source* and it tries to have as little dependencies as possible.

The various parts that make up `liwe3` can be used together for maximum performance and value, but they can also be used separately, so you can get the most out of `liwe3` without having to install all the dependencies.

It is like a box of chocolate: you can choose the parts you want, or you can eat the whole box.
